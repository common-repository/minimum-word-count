Set a minimum word count required to publish a post.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to set a minimum word count required to publish a post. You have the option to exempt administrators from this requirement. As part of this plugin, a "Word Count" column is added to the post listing pages. Also, on the post editing pages, the "Word Count" field just below the content box is now changed to "Live Word Count" and updated as you type. If the current post is below the minimum word count setting, the count will turn red.
